These are the open source projects I currently maintain.

### Crypter

Potentially a huge waste of time.

### BlazorSodium

A very thin wrapper over the libsodium.js npm package.
Using Libsodium in Blazor WASM projects is now trivially easy.

* https://www.nuget.org/packages/BlazorSodium

### EasyMonads

Adds support for `Maybe<T>` and `Either<TL, TR>` monads for the C# programming language.
